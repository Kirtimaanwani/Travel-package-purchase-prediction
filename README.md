Tourism is one of the most rapidly growing global industries and tourism forecasting is
becoming an increasingly important activity in planning and managing the industry.
Because of high fluctuations of tourism demand, accurate predictions of purchase of
travel packages are of high importance for tourism organizations.


The goal is to predict whether the customer will purchase the travel or not.
